Building and deploying the site
===============================

The build system uses a git 'superproject' repo ``pytch-releases`` to
coordinate the build process, both for beta deployments and also
versioned release deployments.  TODO: Finish this explanation.

Possible TODOs:

  contributing SHA1s somewhere central.
